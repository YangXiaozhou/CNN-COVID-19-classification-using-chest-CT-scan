We're going to use a functional programming style to help build intuition. To make matters easier, we'll use a dictionary called `model` to store all data associated with the neural network (the weight matrices, the  bias vectors, etc.) and pass that into functions as a single argument. We'll also assume that the activation functions are the same in all the layers (i.e., the *logistic* or *sigmoid* function) to simplify the implementation. Production codes usually use an object-oriented style to build networks and, of course, are optimized for efficiency (unlike what we'll develop here)."
